# spigot-dev-env

This repository provides scripts to automatically compile all Spigot and CraftBukkit versions using Spigot's BuildTools - which will also install them all to your local maven repository (with NMS API included).
The `servinstall.py` script will also create servers for all Minecraft versions and the `pluginstall.py` script can be used to install a Minecraft plugin jar to the `plugins` folder of all the servers.

## Usage
First clone this git repository to your computer by running the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ben-D-Anderson/spigot-dev-env.git
```

Navigate into the created folder `spigot-dev-env` with the following command:
```bash
cd spigot-dev-env
```

Ensure you follow the necessary steps for your operating system as described by the [Spigot BuildTools prerequisites](https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/buildtools/#prerequisites).

Open `config.json` and set the paths to the java executable files on your system for each java version in the `java_versions` section.
Java 8 is required to build versions up to (but not including) 1.17 and Java 16 is required for all higher versions (including 1.17).

Example for Windows:
```json
"java_versions":{
  "8":"C:\\Windows\\Program Files\\Java\\jre1.8.0_221\\bin\\java.exe",
  "16":"C:\\Windows\\Program Files\\Java\\jre16.0.2\\bin\\java.exe"
}
```

Example for Unix:
```json
"java_versions":{
  "8":"/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64/jre/bin/java",
  "16":"/usr/lib/jvm/java-16-openjdk-amd64/bin/java"
}
```

Paths will vary for each user so make sure you locate your Java installations and update the `config.json` accordingly.

You can now build all the Spigot and Craftbukkit versions referenced in the `config.yml` under the `mc_versions` section using the following command:
```bash
python3 servinstall.py
```
This command will create Minecraft servers for all installed Spigot versions, and place them in the `servers` directory - this can make testing a multi-version plugin much easier.
It will also install the Spigot and CraftBukkit versions with the NMS API to your local maven repository so they can be easily referenced in your pom.xml during development.
See the following example for 1.8:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.bukkit</groupId>
    <artifactId>craftbukkit</artifactId>
    <version>1.8-R0.1-SNAPSHOT</version>
    <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.spigotmc</groupId>
    <artifactId>spigot-api</artifactId>
    <version>1.8-R0.1-SNAPSHOT</version>
    <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
```
The `servinstall.py` script uses BuildTools to compile Spigot and CraftBukkit and can take a long time as a result, on my machine it took a total of ~50 minutes for all versions to be installed.

A script has also been provided in this repository to effortlessly deploy a Minecraft plugin to all of the generated servers using the following command:
```bash
python3 pluginstall.py <plugin_jar_path>
```
